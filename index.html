                    It’s essential to keep an eye on what people are saying about your business online, as it can greatly impact how trustworthy your brand is perceived.

                    According to Brightlocal research, 85% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. In contrast, a positive review can make 73% of people have more faith in your business. With this influence hanging on customer feedback, engaging with them through a dedicated virtual assistant could be the difference between success and failure.
